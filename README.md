#PUTILS
General utils libraries in Java, Python, JS and whatever language I find to test myself in the future


Contains a lightweight library in Java providing various auxiliary functions and utilities. Includes Math, Trees, Sorting, Searching and more fun stuff to be added.

####Why another Util library you say?

  First, because I want to. Second, it's a way for me to have some of the stuff I need in one place. Second, I think we(I) have been using all these nice algorithms and data structures and we have lost completely contact with how they actually work. For me to learn something I *program* it.
  
####Is there not better and built - in functionality in Java already?

See above


###Java Math
To define the wanted function (e.g. for integration) one has to create a Class implementing the interface Function:

      new Function() {
            public double function(double n) {
              //sample function. change it to the wanted
              return n*Math.sqrt(1-n);
            }
          }
      

###TODO

1. Search(Java)
2. Sort(Java)
3. Trees(Java)
4. Documentation(Java)
5. Unit tests(Java)
6. Builds(Java)
7. ~~Write this~~

Disclaimer
-----------

Some of the code is NOT mine. I, however, have changed the code to make it more readable and to my preferred style. I include the source at the beginning of each class. Intending to add docs in the future.
